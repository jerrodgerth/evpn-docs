# Introduction

As data center technologies continue to evolve, and the need to offer higher speeds is matched with a need for operational efficiencies and flexibility.
Key to this are the evolving service demands operators are seeing with new requirements driven by new applications that can’t be solved by existing technologies.

Existing layer 2 service technologies such as standard LAN broadcast domains, MPLS/VPLS, and PBB are both proven solutions for delivering services, but the control plane approach hasn’t changed and these technologies still rely on Layer 2 flooding and learning to build the forwarding database (FDB).
L3 VPN services leverage BGP for building their FDBs which is more efficient, but doesn’t provide tunneling flexibility.

EVPN introduces a new model for L2 and L3 services delivery that inherits over a decade of operational experience with IP VPN and VPLS in production networks, and incorporates flexibility for service delivery over Layer 3 networks.
In EVPN the control plane and data plane are abstracted and separated.
The multiprotocol –BGP (MP-BGP) control plane protocol carries MAC/IP routing information, and EVPN provides several choices for the data plane encapsulation.


EVPN enables data center operators to meet emerging needs in their networks with a single VPN technology:

* Integrated Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN services
* Data center interconnect (DCI)
* Cloud and virtualization services
* Network simplification with less protocols 
* Operational consistency across services and vendors
